I've been work in TSMC since 2022/3/31. Then, I no longer coding any more. I don't want give it up. But, truth is that doesn't make so much money, when you work for someone. And, I didn't use it for any case stand alone. Or, it was one, but very terrible memory. I paid for learning English on Funday 83k for 3 years yesterday. And, I was think about to clear up my git. but, whatevery, it seems I deleted something I might don't want delete, ha ha. But, it has gone, so, just record for, if future forget.
